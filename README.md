# Spring-data-JPA
Project based on spring data jpa 
In this one to one,one to many and many to many topics are covered
In employee management system one to one and one to many bidirectional mapping is shown wth the help of traditional controller method i.e by creating controllers then using @restcontroller annotation to denote rest apis then service interface and then service implementation class
In RESTful_API_Example_SpringDataREST we have to perform one to one mapping so we have used spring data rest dependency in pom.xml file after which we do not need to create controller and service classes only entities and repository class is  enough to perform the operations and the url is generated automatically which can be seen in json file
In SpringBootDataRESTDemo_many_to_many many to many mapping is done with the use of springdatarest dependency which will exclude creating controller
In SpringBootDataRESTDemo_one_to_many one to many mapping is done with use of springdatarest dependency which will exclude creating controller
Database mysql is used for real time results.all info gets stored in mysql
